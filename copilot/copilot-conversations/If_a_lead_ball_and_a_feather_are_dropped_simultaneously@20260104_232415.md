**user**: If a lead ball and a feather are dropped simultaneously from the same height, which will reach the ground first?

**ai**: 
<think>Hmm, the user is asking about a classic physics thought experiment comparing the fall of a lead ball and a feather. This is clearly testing understanding of gravity and air resistance. 

I recall this is famously demonstrated on the Moon by Apollo astronauts, where both fall at the same rate in vacuum. On Earth, air resistance matters, so the feather falls slower. 

The user might be a student learning basic physics or just curious about everyday phenomena. They didn’t specify context, so I’ll keep it simple but include both the ideal case (vacuum) and real-world case (with air). 

No need for complex math here—just clear explanation with the key takeaway that mass doesn’t affect acceleration in gravity alone. Maybe mention Galileo since he pioneered this idea. 

Avoid overcomplicating; stick to the core contrast between vacuum vs. atmosphere.</think>In a **vacuum** (where there is no air resistance), **both the lead ball and the feather will hit the ground at the same time**, regardless of their mass or material. This is because gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate — around 9.8 m/s² on Earth — when no other forces are involved.

On **Earth**, in the presence of air, the feather falls more slowly due to air resistance, which has a much greater effect on its large surface area relative to its low mass. The lead ball, being dense and aerodynamic, will fall faster in everyday conditions.

This classic demonstration was famously performed on the Moon by astronaut David Scott during Apollo 15, where he dropped a hammer and a feather and they hit the lunar surface simultaneously in the vacuum.
